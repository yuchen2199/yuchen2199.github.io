### Hi there, I am Yuchen Zhou (Âë®Êò±Ëá£)!

I am currently a Ph.D. student at the School of Intelligent Systems Engineering, [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Chao Gou](https://chaogou.github.io/) and Prof. [Guang Tan](https://ise.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/teacher01/1354976.htm). I am also a student member of both IEEE and ACM. Previously, I was a research intern at [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/), mentored by Dr. Jiuqi Han and Dr. [Ali Israr](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=lo4v844AAAAJ).
I received honored B.S. degree from [University of Science and Technology Beijing](https://www.ustb.edu.cn/) in 2021, and was a short-term visiting student at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/).


<!--Currently, my research aims to enhance AI agents' ability to understand complex interactions by simulating human cognitive processes and incorporating human knowledge, thereby facilitating more effective and user-friendly human-machine interactions.  -->

üîç Research Interests
------
My research aims to enable AI agents to understand the multi-modal world in a human-like manner, fostering the development of efficient and user-friendly human-machine interaction systems, such as autonomous driving and robotics. I draw inspiration from human cognitive processes, knowledge, and gaze pattern to guide AI models in performing downstream tasks.
My recent interests include but are not limited to **multi-modal understanding** and **multi-modal foundation models**.
