I am currently a M.S. student at the School of Intelligent Systems Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, supervised by A.P. [Chao Gou](https://chaogou.github.io/). Before that, I received the B.S. degree from University of Science and Technology Beijing.

During my undergraduate years, I was widely involved in several AI-related topics such as humanoid robot (RoboCup), wearable navigation device for blind people, intelligent car, and machine game. Currently, I am more focused on computer vision research, especially on scene understanding for autonomous driving, including driver attention prediction, pedestrian intention prediction, traffic interaction, traffic scene graph, and so on. Meanwhile, I also pay attention to human-object interaction, scene graph generation, video understanding, and other tasks of natural scene understanding. I look forward to doing research with both academic and commercial value.

Research Interests
------
- **Visual Attention**: Attention Prediction, Scanpath Prediction, Attention-Guided Deep Model
- **Human-centric Perception**: Intention, Interaction, Behavior, VQA for Blind People
- **Autonomous Driving Perception**: Traffic Scene Graph, Driving Behavior Understanding
